HIGHER_OR_LOWER MINIGAME INSTRUCTIONS
Understanding the 'deck' of cards:
- the order of the types of card (highest to lowest);
'A', 'K', 'Q', 'J', '10', '9', '8', '7', '6', '5', '4',
'3', '2'
- 'A' = Ace, 'K' = King, 'Q' = Queen, 'J' = Jack and the
numbers are just the numbers they represent
- like a regular deck, the deck of cards includes the four
suits; spades, diamonds, clubs or hearts for each card type.
(the suits has no affect on whether the card is higher/lower)
- where a revealed card is of the same type but a different
suit to the previous card, it will be counted as a correct
guess.
To play:
1) At the start, a random card will be displayed from the
deck of cards and you will be asked if you think the next
card to be revealed will be 'higher' or 'lower' than this.
2) Once you've entered your choice, the next card will be
revealed.
3) If you guessed correctly you will be asked again for
whether the next card will be 'higher' or 'lower' than this
newly revealed card.
4) The game will end once you make an incorrect guess and your
score will be your guess streak (number of correct guesses).
Enjoy the game!
