HIGHER_OR_LOWER MINIGAME INSTRUCTIONS
Understanding the 'deck' of cards:
- order of the types of card, highest to lowest;
'A', 'K', 'Q', 'J', '10', '9', '8', '7', '6', '5', '4',
'3', '2'
(regardless of suit)
- 'A' = Ace, 'K' = King, 'Q' = Queen, 'J' = Jack and the
numbers are just the numbers they represent.
- the deck of cards includes four of each type of card
each with a different suit; spades, diamonds, clubs or
hearts.
To play:
1) At the start, a random card will be displayed from the
deck of cards and you will be asked if you think the next
card to be revealed will be 'higher' or 'lower' than this.
2) Once you've entered your choice, the next card will be
revealed.
3) If you guessed correctly you will be asked again for
whether the next card will be 'higher' or 'lower' than this
newly revealed card.
4) The game will end once you make an incorrect guess and your
score will be your guess streak (number of correct guesses).
(The higher the score the better) 
Enjoy the game!
