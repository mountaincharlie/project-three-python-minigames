Minesweeper Minigame Instructions
Based on the same basic logic of the full Minesweeper game, to play the
Minesweeper Minigame, simply:
1) Select a coordinate on the grid by entering a row number,
followed by a column number, as prompted.
2) Then, for that coordinate, either choose to (a) reveal its contents (which
will be a mine 'M' or a number) or (b) insert/remove a flag 'F'.
3)(a) If the corrdinate contains a mine 'M' the game will be over and if it
contains a number, this indicates the number of mines located in any of its 8
surrounding coordinates.
3)(b) The flag option allows you to choose to either (i) insert a flag at the
coordinates (if you believe there may be a mine there) or (ii) remove a flag
from the coordinates (if believe you have placed it there incorrectly)
4) Continue to enter coordinates and reveal their contents or insert/remove
flags until you hit a mine or successfully flag all of the mines.
Successfully flagging all of the mines will complete the game.
Your score is the number of coordinates you revealed before comlpetion.
(The lower the score the better) 
Enjoy the game!
